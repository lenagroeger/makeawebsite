  <h1>An Online Portfolio – From Scratch!</h1>

      <h2>Part 1: Let's Make a Website</h2></div>

      <p>Go to <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> and sign up for a new account if you don't already have one. Don't worry, Github isn't scary! We'll walk through it together.  </p>
      <img src="img/github1.jpg">
      <p>Now that you have a brand new Github account, do the following:  </p>

      <ul>
        <li>In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click  and then select <b>New repository</b>.</li>
        <li>Name your repository <code>hello-world</code>.</li>
        <li>Write a short description.</li>
        <li>Select <b>Initialize this repository with a README</b>.</li>

        <img src="img/create-new-repo.jpg">



        <li>You should end up with a new repo, called <strong>hello-world</strong>.</li>

        <img src="img/firstsite.jpg">

</ul>


      <p>Now let's make a new branch. Our branch will be called <code>gh-pages</code>. Make sure you include that dash!</p>
      <ul>

       <li>Go to your new repository <code>hello-world</code>.</li>
       <li>Click the drop down at the top of the file list that says <b>branch: master</b>.</li>
       <li>Type a branch name, <code>gh-pages</code>, into the new branch text box.</li>
       <li>Select the blue <b>Create branch</b> box or hit “Enter” on your keyboard.</li>

       <img src="img/branch.gif">

      </ul>


      <p>Now let's make a new file. Hover over "Add File" and click on "Create new file." You'll be taken to a new page</p>
      <img src="img/newfile.png">
      <p> You'll have the option to "Name your file..." Let's name it <strong>index.html</strong> </p>
      <img src="img/nameyourfile.jpg">
      <p> We're also going to put in the following text into this new file: <code>&lt;h1&gt;My New Site!&lt;/h1&gt;</code> </p>
      <img src="img/newwebsite.jpg">

      <p>Now scroll down to the bottom and click "Commit new file" </p>
      <img src="img/commit.jpg">

      <p>Now navigate to the following url: <strong>[github-username].github.io/[your-repo-name]</strong>. Your repo in this case is "hello-world". My url is: <strong>lenagroeger.github.io/hello-world</strong></p>
      <img src="img/sample.jpg">

      <p>Congrats! Now you have your own website, hosted on the internet for free!</p>

      <img src="img/leo.gif">

      <p>But this is just the beginning. Now we have to write all the HTML and CSS to make your pages more than just a blank white page with "My New Site." That's what we'll do next.</p>


      <h2>Part 2: Build your Online Portfolio</h2>

      <p>Repeat the steps above to make a new repo called <code>portfolio</code></p>

      <img src="img/newrepo3.gif">

      <p>Download <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">Github for Mac or Windows</a>.</p>

      <p>We're going to get the repo we were working on before onto our own computer so we can edit it more easily. </p>
      
      <p>Click on "Clone a Repository" from the Github for Desktop menu</p>

      <img src="img/clone2.jpg">



      <p>It'll ask you for your Github username/repository, then where you want to save this repository on your computer. I saved it in my "Code" folder on my desktop. </p>

      <img src="img/clonelocation.jpg">

      <p>Now I have my folder, but it doesn't have my index.html file in it! That cuz I'm still on the <code>master</code> branch, not the <code>gh-pages</code> branch. Let's switch that in our Github for Desktop. </p>

      <img src="img/selectbetterbranch.jpg">

      <p>And then click on <b>Fetch origin</b> to get us up to date with the <code>gh-pages</code> branch.</p>

      <img src="img/fetch.jpg">

      <p>Now my folder should be up to date!</p>

      <img src="img/portfolioupdate.jpg">


      <p>Now let's make some changes to our index.html file. Open up your portfolio folder in Sublime Text and edit it!</p>

      
      <img src="img/changes.jpg">



      <p>Save that, and go back to Github for Desktop.</p>

<img src="img/changesrecognized.jpg">


  <p>It should recgonize that you made those changes!! Now give this change a summary, and click on <b>Commit to gh-pages</b></p>
<img src="img/commitchanges.jpg">


  <p>Hurray! You just made your first commit from Github for Desktop. But in order to get those changes up to your published site, you're gonna have to do one more thing. Click on the <b>Push origin</b> button.</p>


  <p>Now those changes are pushed up to the internet, and if you reload your portfolio page you should be able to see them. (Remeber the url for that? <b>[github-username].github.io/[your-repo-name]</b> So in my case: <b>lenagroeger.github.io/portfolio</b> </p>

<img src="img/newportfolioupdated.jpg">




      <p>So now, figure out what you want to include in your portfolio (first off, your name should probably go on there). But what about links to clips and projects? Photos? A bio? A contact section? All of this is up to you.</p>

      <p>If you want to begin with a super basic template, check out this one: <a href="http://lenagroeger.s3.amazonaws.com/makeawebsite/template.html" download>template.html</a></p>

      <p>If you were to just copy and past this entire file into your index.html file, you'd end up with this:</p>
      <img src="img/template.jpg">

      <p>But that's boring! Go ahead and spend sometime making this page your own, using all you've learned about HTML, CSS and design.</p>

      <h2>Part 3: Resources</h2>

      <p>Of course, many of you will want to do more that just the basic template. Here are a number of online portfolios that may be useful for a bit of inspiraton: </p>
